Dr. Lei, Xiaoming (Èõ∑ÊôìÈ∏£) is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/) at the [Hong Kong Polytechnic Univeristy](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cee/) (PolyU). He worked with Prof. [You Dong](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cee/people/academic-staff/dr-you-dong/) in the [Low-Carbon, Urban Resilience, and Intelligent Maintenance Lab](https://youdongpolyu.weebly.com/). Before joining PolyU, Lei received his Ph.D. degree from [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/) in 2021 under the supervision of Prof. [Limin Sun](https://bridge.tongji.edu.cn/d9/a3/c14928a186787/page.htm) and Prof. [Ye Xia](https://bridge.tongji.edu.cn/5f/e6/c14929a155622/page.htm). During his Ph.D. career, Lei visited Prof. [Farzin Zareian](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/farzin-zareian)'s [Performance Based Earthquake Engineering Laboratory](https://pbee.eng.uci.edu/) at [Univeristy of California, Irvine](https://www.uci.edu/). 

Lei focuses on the artificial intelligence-enhenced structural health monitoring and sustainability-informed life-cycle intelligent management of infrastructure systems. He has published more than 20 papers at the strucural engineering-related top international journals and conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1hf-sagAAAAJ&hl=en'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>150+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1hf-sagAAAAJ&hl=en'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). His contributions have been recognized through the 2022 International Associate Bridge and Structure Engineering (IABSE) Outstanding Young Engineering Contribution Award, 2022 PolyU Centrally Funded Postdoctoral Fellowship, etc.. Lei served as the Co-Topic Editor for topic ["AI Enhanced Civil Infrastructure Safety"](https://www.mdpi.com/topics/6BG3A25792) of six journals in MDPI. He also served as the session chair in 8th International Association for Life-Cycle Civil Engineering (IALCCE 2023) and the 31st KKHTCNN Symposium on Civil Engineering, and the members of the organizing committee for 15th East Asia-Pacific Conference on Structural Engineering and Construction (EASEC15).
