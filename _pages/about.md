Dr. Lei, Xiaoming (Èõ∑ÊôìÈ∏£) is currently serving as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/) at the [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cee/) (PolyU). He worked with Prof. [You Dong (Ëë£‰ºò)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cee/people/academic-staff/dr-you-dong/) in the [Urban Resilience and Intelligent Maintenance Lab](https://youdongpolyu.weebly.com/). Prior to his role at PolyU, Lei completed his Ph.D. degree in 2021 from [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/), where he was supervised by Changjiang Scholar Professor [Limin Sun (Â≠ôÂà©Ê∞ë)](https://bridge.tongji.edu.cn/d9/a3/c14928a186787/page.htm) and Prof. [Ye Xia (Â§èÁÉ®)](https://bridge.tongji.edu.cn/5f/e6/c14929a155622/page.htm). During his Ph.D., Lei had the opportunity to visit Prof. [Farzin Zareian](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/farzin-zareian)'s [Performance Based Earthquake Engineering Laboratory](https://pbee.eng.uci.edu/) at [University of California, Irvine](https://www.uci.edu/). 

Dr. Lei focuses on the artificial intelligence-enhenced structural health monitoring and sustainability-informed life-cycle intelligent management of infrastructure systems. He has published more than 20 papers at the top strucural engineering-related international journals and conferences with total google scholar citations <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1hf-sagAAAAJ&hl=en'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>. His contributions have been recognized through the 2022 International Associate Bridge and Structure Engineering (IABSE) Outstanding Young Engineer Contribution Award, 2022 PolyU Centrally Funded Postdoctoral Fellowship, etc. Lei serve as the Topic Editor for topic "AI Enhanced Civil Infrastructure Safety" of six journals in MDPI. He also appointed as the session chair in 8th International Association for Life-Cycle Civil Engineering (IALCCE 2023), 12th International Conference on Bridge Maintenance, Safety and Management (IABMAS 2024) and the 31st KKHTCNN Symposium on Civil Engineering, and the organizing committee members for 15th East Asia-Pacific Conference on Structural Engineering and Construction (EASEC-15).
